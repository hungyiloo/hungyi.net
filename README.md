Instead of a blog, I now publish a subset of my notes as my digital garden using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

My notes themselves are not stored in this repo, as I wish to keep some of them personal and private. I build off this external source by running `npx quartz build -d /path/to/my/notes`.

Old blog content from the previous incarnation of [hungy.net](https://hungyi.net) may be slowly migrated over to this garden, if I think it's still relevant.
