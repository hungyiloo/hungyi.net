#+DESCRIPTION: Because who wouldn't want cute emojis in their Emacs completion candidates? Learn how to make the emacs-emojify and selectrum packages cooperate nicely.

If you use both [[https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify][emacs-emojify]] and [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/][selectrum]] and you're having trouble getting emoji to show up properly in the list of completion candidates, especially after the latest round of selectrum updates (commit 21cee86) then I have an elisp configuration snippet that may help you.

Note that this configuration is written for the [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] distribution. If you're using vanilla Emacs, you may need to replace the calls to ~use-package!~ and ~after!~ with their vanilla counterparts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! emojify
  :commands (emojify-mode)
  :config
  (after! selectrum
    (advice-add #'selectrum--format-candidate
                :around
                (defun my/emojify-selectrum-candidate (orig-fun &rest args)
                  (emojify-string (apply orig-fun args))))))
#+end_src

* Explanation
Since the new version of selectrum builds the candidate list as a string directly in memory, then displayed using an overlay -- without a buffer to contain the list of candidates -- emojify won't work automatically because it works on buffer contents only.

However, there's actually a utility function in =emacs-emojify= that allows direct emojification of a string input: ~emojify-string~. As long as we ~advice-add~ this function around the output string of ~selectrum--format-candidate~ to emojify it, when selectrum uses those candidate strings to build the overlay, it picks up the emojified text properties.

VoilÃ  ðŸŽ‰!
