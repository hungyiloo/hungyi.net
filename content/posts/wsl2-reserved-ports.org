Allegedly [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/62359555][a botched Windows update resets the dynamic TCP port range]] in some cases. When this happens, [[https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/3171][Hyper-V ends up aggressively reserving]] it for its own [[https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsnetdoc/2017/09/18/windows-container-networking-for-windows-10-and-windows-server-2016/][Windows Container Host Networking Service (HNS)]]. The end result for me? I've occasionally been unable to connect to my Angular app running on port 4200 within WSL2.

Today I remembered that Windows had some sort of port reservation/exclusion mechanism, so I dug up the relevant command and sure enough, Angular's port 4200 had (presumably) been stolen by Hyper-V[fn:1].

The following steps fixed it for me:
1. On my Windows host in PowerShell, I ran ~netsh int ipv4 set dynamic tcp start=51001 num=5000~ to reset the dynamic port range to an area which I knew none of my apps used.        
2. I also ran ~reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\hns\State /v EnableExcludedPortRange /d 0 /f~ to disable the HNS port exclusion behavior as ~netsh int ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp~ showed a lot of excluded ports that were not attributed to anything else.
3. Reboot

Hopefully things are stable from now on. If not, I'll update this post with further info.

[fn:1] In case you're wondering, [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-faq][Hyper-V is used by the new WSL2]], since it runs as a lightweight "virtual machine" in the background. I couldn't just switch it offâ€”although you can also fix it that way if you don't need WSL2.
